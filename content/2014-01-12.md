Summary: Hello, everyone...

Hello, everyone.  I've just started working with [Raising the Floor](http://raisingthefloor.org/ "Raising the Floor").  I'm currently working on the [Common Terms Registry](http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Common_Terms_Registry "Common Terms Registry"), and will soon be working on the [Unified Listing](http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Unified_Listing "Unified Listing").  I will be using this blog to share things I learn as part of my journey with the team.
